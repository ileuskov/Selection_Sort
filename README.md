Hello there! This is a small sorting algorithm of arrays in Java using selection sort

Although Java as many programming languages has its own methods to sort arrays, I think it's important to understand how does the sorting process in programming works.

Selection Sort is one of the simplest solution for sorting in Java and is quite slow comparing to QuickSort or HeapSort. 
It is unable to sort big arrays, but is quite simple and has a decent performance on some smaller arrays.

The current program has 2 features:

1. a user can set the length of an array that is than filled with the random numbers
2. this array is then showed unsorted and moments later sorted in ascending order


Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
